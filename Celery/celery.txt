                                                === Celery ===

==> Need of Celery
-> HTTP - Request and Response cycles
-> Executing queries / processing data
-> Django processing -> Users wait for response (before any action is taken)
-> Server Resources are limited
-> Task / Process manager (Task Queues)
-> Celery -> executes processes (Tasks)
    Different thread (on demand / periodically)
-> Task Queues -> Distribute Workloads

==> Message Broker
-> Django -> Task Messages -> Message Broker
-> RabbitMQ / Redis
-> Django -> RabbitMQ -> Celery (Worker processes)

==> RabbitMQ Conf
-> sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
-> sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
-> sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
-> systemctl status rabbitmq-server
